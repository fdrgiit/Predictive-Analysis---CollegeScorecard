# Predictive-Analysis---CollegeScorecard

My goal is to build a model that would accurately predict the fraction of students enrolled in a 4-year colleges and complete the program in much less than 6 years based on the specific features of the college like rate of admission for all demographics (ADM_RATE_ALL in the DB), total cost of attendance per year average, acceptance rate, average test scores etc. Because of the increasing cost of higher education and the accompanying rise of student debt, it is important to understand the factors that contribute to the post-graduation rate and ability of the students and delve into their ability to pay education loans. This model will increase the transparency and will help students to weigh the trade-offs of different colleges and make more informed decisions.
